# Sprint Challenge: Hash Tables and Blockchain

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint, we learned how hash tables combine two data structures to get the best of both worlds and were introduced into the fascinating world of blockchains. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by solving algorithms in Python using hash tables and add another key feature to your blockchain.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in Python and your command of the concepts and techniques in related to hash tables and blockchains.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager.

## Description

This sprint challenge is divided up into three parts:  Hash tables coding, blockchain coding, and a short interview covering parts of hash tables and blockchain.

## Interview Questions

Explain in detail the workings of a dynamic array:
* What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?

- Acces an array - O(1)
- Add from the front - O(n) -> we always have to traverse the array: if there is space at the end, we need to shift all items by one position. If there isn't, we need to save the array somewhere else in memory which means we need to traverse anyway.
- Remove from the front - O(n) -> all items need to be shifted one space forward when we delete the first item, so we need to traverse the array, therefore it is O(n.)
- Add from the back - worst case O(n), average case O(1) - it depends whether there is space free at the end of the array. Python implementation of an array (List) allocate few extra spaces at the end of the array every time we add items (dependant on the load factor). The amount of free spaces added increase over time, so having to find a new space in memory to save the array happens less and less frequently. When there is space available at the end of the array, it is O(1). When there isn't, it is O(n).
- Remove from the back - O(1) - we just need to make the last item available for anyone else that needs space in memory and that it is.

* What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?
- Worst case scenario when extending the size of an array is that there is no contiguous free space left at the end of the array, so we need to find new contiguous space in memory to fit the size of the array that we want. In that case, we need to save the items in the old array into the new array, hence why it is O(n).

Explain how a blockchain is structured. What are the blocks, what is the chain? How is the data organized?
- A block chain is a chain of blocks. It starts with a genesis block, and the next block contains the hash of the previous block. That second block is hashed, and added to the field "previous hash" of the third block and so on. Each block contains a number of transations, and data related to these transactions: amount, etc. Each block contains a proof. What is a proof? A proof is a number that, when hashed together with the previous block, the proof of work (POW) is reached. Proof of Work is the challenge that blockchain owners set in order to allow miners to create a block. You can only create a block if you ahve passed POW (currently, you need to find a hash that has 17 leading zeros - in other words, you need to find the number that, when hashed with the previous block, it has the 17 leading zeros). Blockchain is a class with attributes, each attribute being a property of the block: amount, transactions, etc.
 
Explain how proof of work functions. How does it operate. How does this protect the chain from attack. What kind of attack is possible?
- Proof of work is a challenge set up by blockchain owners that needs to be passed in order to have the right to create a block. Currently is finding a hash with 17 leading zeros. That is what mining is about: taking the last block, and hash it together with a proof in order to find a hash that starts with 17 leading zeros. Once the proof is found, the miner can create the block and the proof is added to the new block.

## Project Set Up

#### [Hash Tables]

For the hash tables portion of the sprint challenge, you'll be working through two algorithm problems that are amenable to being solved efficiently using a hash table. You know the drill at this point. Navigate into each exercise's directory, read the instructions for the exercise laid out in the README, implement your solution in the .py skeleton file, then make sure your code passes the tests by running the test script with make tests.

A hash table implementation has been included for you already. Your task is to get the tests passing (using a hash table to do it). You can remind yourself of what hash table functions are available by looking at the hashtable.py file that is included in each exercise directory (note that the hash table implementations for both exercises differ slightly).

*You may not use any advanced, built-in Python functions to solve these problems.*

#### [Blockchain]

For the blockchain portion of the challenge, you will be writing code for a new miner that will solve a different Proof of Work algorithm than the one we have been working with.

Your goal is to mine at least one coin.  Keep in mind that with many people competing over the same coins, this may take a long time.  By our math, we expect that an average solution should be the first to find a solution at least once in an hour or two of mining.
